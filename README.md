Theori's submissions for the DARPA AIxCC ASC event.
(Note that files have been renamed to simplify browsing)

We are only publishing POVs and patches for the challenges made
public by DARPA (nginx, and linux--in which we produced no POVs).

If the other challenges (sqlite, Apache Tika, Jenkins) are
made public, we will release our patches and POVs for those as well!
